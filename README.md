# Nashville Gig Hub

This is a solo project that serves as the capstone to sum up the first 3 months at Nashville Software School. Built using Javascript, React, JSX and CSS.

Purpose: 
Often local Nashville artists’ shows get lost in the sheer amount of events happening in town if they’re not one of the big names. Nashville Gig Hub will be a place for Nashville based artists to post gigs they have in town, focused more on the small to mid-sized and “indie” artists and venues.
